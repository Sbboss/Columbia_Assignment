**Steps Involved**
1. Import Libraries: Essential libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization are imported to facilitate data handling and graphical representation.
2. Ingest Data from CSV: The project reads order data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for structured data manipulation.
3. Manage Different Data Types: The code checks and manages various data types within the DataFrame, converting quantities to integers and ensuring date columns are in the correct datetime format.
4. Use Your Function for Data Analysis: A custom function categorizes orders based on their total value, creating a new column that enhances the dataset for targeted analysis.
5. Visualize Data: The project includes visualization steps to create graphical representations of the data, such as bar charts that display the distribution of order value categories, aiding in trend analysis.
6. Wrangle Data: Finally, the code handles missing values, filters the dataset for specific criteria (like high-value orders), and saves the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file for future use.
